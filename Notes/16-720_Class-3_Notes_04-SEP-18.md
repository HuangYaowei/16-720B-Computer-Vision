# Computer Vision

## Class 3 - 04 SEP 2018

### Correlation
- Natural images have **lot of redundancy** and are correlated (see lecture-3, slides 6-7)
- This fact is used in compression and streaming
- Random noisy image when convoluted with a template will result in single white dot response, it is completely uncorrelated
- This means they are more correlated in local regions
- Same applies to speech
- CNNs are good at learning this local correlation

### Dirac Function
- **Numpy vectorizes column wise**
- L0 norm counts the number of 1s in the vector (Slides 12-13)

#

### TODO
- [ ] Review SVD, PCA, Eigen Vectors
